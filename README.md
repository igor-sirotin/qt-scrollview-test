This project shows Qt `Flickable`/`ScrollView` components twitching bug.

Scrolling a ScrollView out of bound **with trackpad** (mouse works ok) on a MacBook M1 leads to content short twitch.
Works fine on Windows.

I tried it with different versions of Qt.
And I also tried to switch `ScrollView` to `Flickable`.

## Qt 5.14.2 [MacOS, Apple M1]

❌ `Flickable`
❌ `ScrollView`

## Qt 6.3.0 [MacOS, Apple M1]

✅ `Flickable`
❌ `ScrollVew` - now it doesn't twitch, but gets stuck out of bounds)
